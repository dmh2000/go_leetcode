I developed this code while doing some HackerRank challenges. 

The more complex things like graphs and search trees are C++ implementations based on 
the Java implementations in Algorithms by Sedgewick, algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code .
Btw, his course on Coursera is excellent.

FYI: not all the code is complete. It was built incrementally while doing the challenges and in some cases pieces weren't needed.
